# Titanic

**Titanic** is a small, hackathon-started hobby project, designed to synchronise host name aliases and Bash shortcuts between all of my Linux devices and servers. I planned it as a "jump in the deep end" learning project, taking on several new-to-me technologies at once, including:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Jade
- SCSS
- CoffeeScript
- Bash programming

## Progress

This tool is a *work in progress*, but takes a back-seat to some of my other projects.

- ~~Device Management~~
- ~~Alias Management~~
- ~~Bash Shortcut Management~~
- API
- Command Line Tool

*Why "Titanic"?* Well, it's designed to sync everything...
